"""Run every library test, ignored or not, with the prepared vanilla data, against a list of known failures.

Usage: ignored_tests.py PACKAGE...  (HORIZON_TEST_RESOURCES points at the prepared 26.3 data)

Each package's library tests run with `--include-ignored`: the #[ignore]d ones that need the data, and the
ones that return early without it, which `verify` (no data) passes without checking anything. The packages
in INTEGRATION_TESTS also run their `tests/` integration tests. The job fails when a test fails that
tools/ci/ignored-tests-known-failures.txt doesn't list, when a listed test passes (take it off the
list: the list only shrinks), and when a listed test no longer exists. A test marked `flaky` there
may pass or fail; one marked `harness` is a parity harness's step, run by its harness with the
environment it sets, and is skipped here; one marked `gpu` needs a graphics adapter and runs only where
the runner has a Vulkan driver (an ICD file), and must pass there.

Only test names, results, panic locations and explicitly marked screen-effect event loop errors
are printed: the prepared data is Mojang's, and a failing assertion could quote it.
